![Simple cheesy pasta.](/static/banners/cacio-e-pepe.jpg)

## Ingredients
- salt
- 6 oz uncooked pasta (eg, egg tagliolini, bucatini, or spaghetti)
- 3 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp freshly cracked black pepper
- ¾ cup finely grated grana padano or parmesan
- ⅓ cup finely grated pecorino

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil, generously seasoned with salt, over high heat.
2. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, until about 2 minutes before tender.
3. While the pasta is cooking, melt 2 tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
4. Add the pepper and cook, swirling the pan, until toasted, about 1 minute.
5. Drain the pasta, reserving ¾ cup of the pasta water.
6. Add ½ cup of the pasta water to the skillet and bring it to a simmer.
7. Add the pasta and the remaining butter. Reduce heat to low.
8. Add the grana padano, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove the pan from the heat.
9. Add the pecorino, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente.
10. Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.
11. Serve immediately.
