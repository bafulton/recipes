![A tasty treat first introduced by Andrea Fischer.](/static/banners/rhubarb-custard-pie.jpg)

## Ingredients
#### Crust
- 1 frozen store-bought pie crust in a pie plate
- 1 large egg white
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- kosher salt

#### Filling
- 1 pound (or 454 grams) fresh rhubarb, sliced into ½-inch chunks
- 1½ cups granulated sugar
- ⅓ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 4 tbsp butter, melted
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp lemon juice

## Instructions
#### Crust
1. Pre-bake the crust per the instructions on the box.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, lemon juice, and salt. 
3. Use a pastry brush to coat the bottom and sides of the pie crust with a thin layer of egg wash.
4. Bake, uncovered, for an additional 5 minutes.

#### Filling
1. Place the rhubarb in a bowl and toss it in ¼ cup of sugar.
2. Whisk together the remaining 1¼ cup sugar, flour, eggs, butter, cream, and lemon juice until combined.
3. Pour the filling into the prepared crust and scatter the rhubarb evenly on top, discarding any liquid at the bottom of the bowl.
4. Bake the pie at 350° for 60 to 65 minutes, or until the edges of the filling are set but the center still wobbles slightly.
5. Cool the pie on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving.
