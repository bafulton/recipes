# Hello Dollies
![This Huffman favorite brings butterscotch to Christmas.](/static/banners/hello-dollies.jpeg)

## Ingredients
- 2 cups graham cracker crumbs
- ½ cup butter, melted
- 1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk
- 1½ cups semisweet chocolate chips
- 1 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- ½ cup white chocolate chips or butterscotch chips

## Instructions
1. Grease a 9x13 pan. Line it with parchment paper and leave an overhang on the sides.
2. In a large bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter until the crumbs are evenly moistened.
3. Press the wet cracker crumbs into the bottom of the greased baking dish.
4. Bake at 325° for 8-10 minutes until lightly brown.
5. Sprinkle the semi-sweet chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, and white chocolate chips over the hot crust. Use a spatula to spread it out and cover the crust evenly.
6. Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the top but do not stir.
7. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until lightly browned and the coconut flakes are golden.
8. Let it cool to room temperature. Using the overhangs, lift the baked dish onto a flat surface.
9. Cut into bars with a sharp knife.
