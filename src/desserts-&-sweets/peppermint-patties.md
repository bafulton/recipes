Jeannine’s Peppermint Patties

1 8oz. pkg. cream cheese softened

1 teaspoon peppermint extract

9 cups confectioner’s sugar

In large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and extract until smooth.  Gradually add confectioners’ sugar, one cup at a time, beating well  (the dough will be very stiff... you may find that you don’t need all 9 cups).  Shape into 1 inch balls and flatten into patties.  Place on waxed paper; layer patties and waxed paper and refrigerate for one hour or until chilled.  You can try to roll dough into a log instead and slice into patties.

 

1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips

6 Tablespoons shortening

In microwave, melt chips and shortening; stir until smooth.  This can be a little tricky... melt for 1 minute intervals, stirring after each until chocolate is smooth; stirring helps to melt chips and will prevent from overheating.  Cool slightly.  Dip patties in melted chocolate and place on waxed paper until firm; I find that scooping up the patties from the melted chocolate with a fork works best... trial and error.  It is important to let the patties harden completely before layering them in a container... they will look smooched (sp?).  I also melt ¾ cup milk chocolate and 1 1/2 Tablespoon shortening in a Ziploc bag, cut a tiny hole in one corner and drizzle back and forth over dipped patties to create a festive designJJ.  And... sometimes I sprinkle crushed peppermints on top instead.  Another hint... if you have room in the fridge you can lay the dipped patties on cookie sheets in a single layer to harden completely before layering in a storage container.  They should be kept in the fridge until ready to serve or packaged.
