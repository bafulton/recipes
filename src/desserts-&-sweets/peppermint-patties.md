## Summary
Jeannine’s Peppermint Patties

## Ingredients
- 1 8oz. pkg. cream cheese softened
- 1 teaspoon peppermint extract
- 9 cups confectioner’s sugar
- 1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 ½ cups milk chocolate chips
- 6 Tablespoons shortening
- Crushed peppermints or candy canes

## Instructions
#### Patties
1. In large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese and extract until smooth.
2. Gradually add confectioners’ sugar, one cup at a time, beating well  (the dough will be very stiff... you may find that you don’t need all 9 cups).
3. Shape into 1 inch balls and flatten into patties. Place on waxed paper; layer patties and waxed paper.
4. Refrigerate for one hour or until chilled.

#### Chocolate
1. In microwave, melt chips and shortening; stir until smooth. This can be a little tricky... melt for 1 minute intervals, stirring after each until chocolate is smooth; stirring helps to melt chips and will prevent from overheating. Cool slightly.
2. Use a fork to dip the patties in melted chocolate and place on waxed paper.
3. Sprinkle crushed peppermints on top.
4. Let the patties harden completely before layering them in a container. Store in the fridge.
