![A classic Thanksgiving dish.](/static/banners/sweet-potato-casserole.jpg)

## Ingredients
#### Filling
- 3-4 large sweet potatoes
- ½ stick butter
- ½ cup milk
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla
- ½ tsp salt
- 2 eggs

#### Topping
- ½ cup flour
- ½ cup brown sugar
- ½ stick butter, melted
- ¼ tsp salt
- ¾ cup chopped pecans (toasted, optionally)
- 1 cup oats (optional)

## Instructions
1. Peel sweet potatoes, chop into 1-inch cubes, and simmer until soft (~15-20 minutes). (Alternatively, bake whole sweet potatoes at 425 for ~1 hour. Less water added makes for a more intense sweet potato flavor.)
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
3. Butter a 9x13 baking dish.
4. Drain the sweet potatoes and mash them.
5. Mix the filling ingredients into the sweet potatoes, put in the baking dish.
6. Combine the topping ingredients and mix until it clumps together. Put on top of the filling.
7. Bake until mostly set in the middle and golden on top (~25-30 minutes). Serve hot/warm.
